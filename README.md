# modules
this is a collection of quasi-modules for some of my roblox scripts (i love http service)   
i don't know why i spend my time with this

### mouse module
this uhh does a few funky raycasts and sends the result to `"InputEvent"` inside it. every frame. forever. this also sends key input data as a `String`       you can change the ignore table with the table it returns (i think)      uhh no warranties
